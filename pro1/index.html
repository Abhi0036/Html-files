<h1>THE BIHAR</h1>
   <div>Bihar's antiquity is evident from its name,
     which is derived from the ancient word "VIHARA" (monastery). 
     It is indeed a land of monasteries. 
     Hindu, Buddhist, Jain, Muslim and Sikh shrines abound in this ancient land where India's first major empires rose and fell.
      Where the ruins of the worlds' earliest university slumbers in the void of time. 
      The passage of Ganga, flowing wide and deep enrich the plains of Bihar before distributing in Bengal's deltoid zone.</div>
